# CSS Step

This project was done with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and pure CSS (no CSS framework).

## Aim

This was an assessment. I'm using it to showcase my skills with React and pure CSS. It is highly responsive. It demonstrates how useful props can be in the React world.
